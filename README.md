# F5OS-DO-tenant
Created two bash scripts that create a BIG-IP tenant within F5OS devices - appliance/chassis and then execute Declarative onboarding for the tenant that is started.

This is primarily a PoC script, so there are a number of values hard-coded in the script for simplicity. These can also be paramaratised.

The script also uploads the DO RPM from the local machine to the BIG-IP. So the RPM needs to be downloaded first.
